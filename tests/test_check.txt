    """Log entry for a (`patient`, `shift`) tuple filled out by nurse. For each
    `shift_day` in a shift, all the tasks in the `CareSchedule` instance
    assigned to the shift are added to this table. A `shift_day` is defined as
    the number of full days that have passed since the start of the shift. This
    allows a `CareSchedule` instance to create sensible log entries for a shift
    regardless of when the shift starts and ends.

    Although records in this table are generated from a `CareSchedule` instance,
    they don't point to this table. This ensures this is a "fact" table whose
    records are not deleted from the database, even if the schedule changes."""
